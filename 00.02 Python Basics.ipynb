    "Python is an interpreter language which means it is not compiled but the source code is parsed during running time and executed by the interpreter.\n",
    "An instance of the interpreter is called kernel.\n",
    "Where classically interpreter languages execute a script and exit afterwards, a lot of modern Python programming is centered around interactive sessions on an interactive Python kernel with some benefits like built-in plot visualization (IPython), that allows additional inputs during runtime, similar to a shell.\n",
    "The IPython kernel keeps all globally defined variables from previous code in scope for future reference.\n",
    "Notebooks make use of that concept by keeping an IPython kernel alive in the background and feeding it the code of whatever cell you wish to execute.\n",
    "The global variable scope then allows to reference functions and variables from other cells.\n",
    "But we need to keep in mind, that all these variables are held in the scope of the kernel and as soon, as we restart the kernel (e.g. when reopening the notebook), the variable scope is gone.\n",
    "It is therefore strictly recommended to keep your cells \"in order\" and not reference upward of the current before "
